    "In this maze environment, the goal is to reach the goal state (G) as fast as possible from the starting state (S). There are four actions – up, down, right, left – which take the agent deterministically from a state to the corresponding neighboring states, except when movement is blocked by a wall (denoted by grey) or the edge of the maze, in which case the agent remains where it is. The reward is +1 on reaching the goal state, 0 otherwise. On reaching the goal state G, the agent returns to the start state S to being a new episode. This is a discounted, episodic task with $\\gamma = 0.95$.\n",
